# ts-sexchange

## Time series analysis of flow of trending tags, community activity and many more (I haven't decided yet)

## Current implementations
### 
1.	Base community details + question and other details scraper (raw)
2.	partial db via mongodump
3.	pickle file for tags and text (can be loaded from cPickle, a python library)
4.	Frequency and plotting done

## To be done
1.	Model creation for auto-tag generation (p-1)
2.	Many undecided & stupid stuff that will come out some day

**NOTE** : Do not pull, many modules are incomplete
