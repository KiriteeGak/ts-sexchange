## Time series analysis of flow of trending tags, commmunity activity and many more (I haven't decided yet)

## Current implementations
### 
1.	Base community details + question and other details scraper (raw)
2.	partial db via mongodump
3.	pickle file for tags and text (can be loaded from cPickle, a python library)

## To be done
1.	model creation for auto-tag generation (p-1)
2.	Manyu undecided & stupid stuff that will come out some day
